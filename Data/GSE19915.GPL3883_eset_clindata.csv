For each channel, the Mean FG - Median BG intensity value was used. Features flagged bad, missing or saturated during image analysis were removed. Poorly measured features with ch1 or ch2 intensities <15 were removed. Data was normalized using pin-based LOWESS algorithm.///platform_id: GPL3883///contact_name: David,,Lindgren///contact_email: david.lindgren@med.lu.se///contact_laboratory: Molecular Pathology///contact_department: Dep of Laboratory Medicine.
